# AGENTS Development Guide

This project is a small React application that implements an RPG-style skill
tree for learning kitchen techniques. Source files live under `src/` and are
organized into components and helper modules. Styling is handled with Tailwind
CSS and utility functions in `src/lib`.

## Coding Guidelines
- Use functional React components and hooks.
- Follow the existing ESLint and Prettier configuration (`npm run lint`).
- Import modules using the `@/` alias defined in `vite.config.js`.

## Development
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Start a local server with `npm run dev` and rebuild with `npm run build`.
- Run `npm run lint` before committing to ensure consistent code style.

## Pull Requests
- Summarize your changes clearly in commit messages and PR descriptions.
- Provide detailed explanations in the PR body so reviewers understand the rationale behind the changes.
