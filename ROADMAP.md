- [x] Improve layout responsiveness (mobile/tablet support).
- [x] Improve skill node tooltips and visual feedback (locked vs unlocked).

**‚ú® Bonus Enhancements Delivered:**
- [x] Dual view modes (grid and professional flow chart)
- [x] Functional learning paths with real-time skill highlighting
- [x] Intelligent profile suggestions with priority ranking
- [x] Cross-tree learning path support
